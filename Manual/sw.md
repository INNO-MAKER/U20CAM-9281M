# InnoMaker UVC Series Camera Software Manual
- UVC cameras comply with UVC protocol and work with web-camera applications out-of-box
- UVC Cameras support windows, linux, MacOs Compatible with UVC drivers
##  What is UVC

A UVC Camera is a camera with a USB interface that meets the standards set for the USB Video Class. This means that every UVC Camera is a USB camera, but not all USB cameras are UVC Cameras, because they might adopt the USB interface without meeting the Video class requirements. Take our current USB3 Camera shield as an example, it’s not a standard video class, and requires extra drivers to work.

Therefore, a major advantage of the UVC cameras is their universal compatibility and flexibility. As they meet the video class standard, you can easily use them on different platforms with a USB port without handling the driver issue, like the Raspberry Pi or a smartphone. It also makes it easier for you to migrate your applications from one platform to another.

At present, our UVC cameras support Windows, Linux, MAC, and Android systems, but do not support the iPhone system.

USB UVC camera modules are designed to comply with the USB Video Class standard, which allows them to be recognized and used as standard video devices by various operating systems without requiring additional drivers. UVC camera modules are widely used in applications such as video conferencing, live streaming, computer vision, and machine vision.
